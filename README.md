# Innerworks Subnet: Improved Security Through Decentralized Innovation

## Overview
The Innerworks Subnet is a decentralized platform designed to drive innovation in cybersecurity through competitive programming challenges. The subnet incentivizes miners to develop and submit code solutions to various technical challenges, with a focus on enhancing security. These solutions can be integrated into real-world products to improve their security features.

## Subnet Functionality
The subnet operates with a flexible, modular structure where new programming challenges can be added or removed based on demand. Miners submit encrypted code solutions to validators, who decrypt and evaluate the submissions after a 24-hour period. This ensures the integrity of the submissions, as the original submission time is preserved, and the solutions cannot be plagiarized. Validators run the submitted code in isolated sandbox environments to ensure accurate and replicable scoring.

Points are awarded based on the quality of each solution, compared to the previous best. The system calculates emissions based on the number of points a miner has, with points decaying linearly over a 14-day period. This incentivizes continuous improvement and active participation in solving challenges.

## Example Challenge
For instance, a programming challenge may involve mimicking human mouse movements to bypass detection algorithms. Miners develop Python scripts to trick the algorithm into believing the mouse movement is human-like. The highest-scoring miner earns points and emissions based on the quality of the solution compared to others.
