# Humanize Behaviour v2 Submission Guide (Active after March [x]st 2025 14:00 UTC)

## Description

**Humanize Behaviour v2** is a challenge designed to test bot scripts' ability to mimic human behavior within a web UI form. It evaluates how effectively a bot can interact with the form, navigate UI elements, engage with form fields, and submit required data accurately and efficiently, with grading based on mouse movement and **keyboard interaction analysis.**

This challenge assesses the precision and sophistication of bot scripts in performing web-based tasks. Miners participating must demonstrate human-like interaction capabilities through their bot scripts when engaging with the web UI form.

## Example Code and Submission Instructions

Example code for the Humanize Behaviour v2 can be found in the [`redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/bot.py`](../../redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/bot.py) file.

### Environment

Your bot script should be compatible with these:

- Python: **3.12**
- Ubuntu: **24.04**
- Docker image: **selenium/standalone-chrome:4.28.1**

### Before You Begin

- Use the template bot script provided in the [`redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/bot.py`](../../redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/bot.py) file.
- Inside `src/bot` folder, you will find the `bot.py` file, which contains the bot script.
- Modify only **`run_bot()`** function while keeping the rest of the code if you do not know what you are doing.
- The bot script must be able to:
    - Use provided `driver`
    - Check all click locations provided in `config` (in given order)
    - Fill in username and password
    - Submit the form
- Do not remove or rename `run_bot` function.

### Things to remember

- Use provided `driver` as your main driver. If you don't follow, you may fail to run the challenge or get a low score.
- Click only in `provided locations`:
    - Clicking extra for input and submit button is ok
    - If your script clicks in wrong order or skips some locations, you will not be able to submit the form
- Make sure the bot scripts run on **`headless browser`**
- Click `login-button` at the end of session; if you press it before, the session will end automatically
- Provide dependencies in [`requirements.txt`](../../redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2/src/bot/requirements.txt)
- The miner docker container must be run in **amd64** (x86_64) architecture because the selenium driver (chromedriver) is not compatible with **arm64** architecture. If managed to run in ARM architecture, then it's up to you.

### 1. Navigate to the Humanize Behaviour v2 Commit Directory

```bash
cd redteam_core/miner/commits/humanize_behaviour_v2
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the Humanize Behaviour v2 submission, run:

```bash
docker build -t my_hub/humanize_behaviour-miner:0.0.1 .

# For MacOS (Apple Silicon) to build AMD64:
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t myhub/humanize_behaviour-miner:0.0.1 .
```

### 3. Log in to Docker

Log in to your Docker Hub account using the following command:

```bash
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub credentials when prompted.

### 4. Push the Docker Image

Push the tagged image to your Docker Hub repository:

```bash
docker push myhub/humanize_behaviour:0.0.1
```

### 5. Retrieve the SHA256 Digest

After pushing the image, retrieve the digest by running:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' myhub/humanize_behaviour:0.0.1
```

### 6. Update active_commit.yaml

Finally, go to the `neurons/miner/active_commit.yaml` file and update it with the new image tag:

```yaml
- humanize_behaviour---myhub/humanize_behaviour@<sha256:digest>
```
